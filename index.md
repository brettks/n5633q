### Q&As

- Avionics: Garmin GTN 750; Garmin GTX345ES ADS-B dual in/out with synthetic vision when linked to tablet with Foreflight or Garmin Pilot; Standard six pack, Dual CDIs with Glideslopes (One Garmin and linked to GTN, the second King linked to KX-155), KX-155 nav/comm radio, Garmin 340 audio panel with 4 place intercom, EGT gauges, Carb temp gauge, Fuel pressure, Manifold pressure, Tachometer all standard.

- Hours flown in each of the past 2 years: 2019 flew 85.2 hours, 2020 so far flew 18.7 hours

- Compression readings at last 2 annual inspections: For some reason last annual I don't see it in the logbook entry but have an email from the IA saying all compressions in the "mid 70s". Last entry in logbook shows 67, 76, 78, 74, but a small exhaust leak at cylinder 1 has been repaired since then, so I suspect that's why #1 improved. Please see logbooks linked above.

- Date of last IFR pitot/static/xpndr cert: Transponder 9/9/2019, Pitot/static 8/25/2018

- Date of last annual insp: 8/23/2019, Mooney Service Center

- Logbook entries from last 2 annual inspections

- Damage history: None

- Fuel weeps or leaks?: Old stain from fuel below wings, have been stable since I owned the plane, prior owner said they were there and he had tanks sealed and that fixed it. Prior owner owned it for 25+ years. There may be a small leak now as I can occasionally see blue streaking. I had the MSC inspect it last annual and they found it "within spec." They said they could do some sealing but recommended just watching it for now. There is a comment of this in the last logbook entry.
